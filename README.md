# DCS_Waypoint_Editor
A hacky version using Santi871's DCS_Waypoint_Editor sources

No multiple missions/stations but one at a time. You select the weapon/station/mission and send the coordinates over to DCS
That way multiple weapons can be used instead of only the JDAM and possible DCS updates won't break usage.

Furthermore I've add the possibility of grabbing coordinates from DCS in WINDOWED Mode, resolution independent.

* Install Python 3.7
